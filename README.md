# News Article Classifier
•	Implementing a Machine Learning Python solution that gives users suggested news articles from topics that they would be interested in

•	Training the pre-processed training data with the test dataset whilst also cross validating the feature and method selection hyper-tuning the parameters for the most optimum performance

•	Comparing the Precision, Recall and F1 scores of multiple supervised learning methods to determine the best classification method such as Stochastic Gradient Descent and Multinomial Naive Bayes and using the probabilities for each words in each topics to return top 10 recommended news articles
